					<h1>100 Days of UI Challenge.</h1>

					<div>
						<p>
							Inspired by Paul Nechita, the guys behind
							Noon Pacific came up with a very simple,
							easy to follow list of 100 prompts. Each
							day, a new prompt is sent out to their
							mailing list subscribers to build and design
							something awesome.
						</p>
						<p>
							To the right was today&apos;s challenge.

					<h1>First and Foremost, I Develop.</h1>

					<div>
						<p>
							Among the many things I dabble in, from music, to web and graphic design, the one area I`ve focused my time and effort the most is in development. From systems and software architecture, to ground-up development and complex implementations.
						</p>

						<p>Anyone who knows me knows this: I love to code. :)<p>

						<p>I may never become one of the best, but I will die knowing I enjoyed every minute I coded.</p>
